## config-hammerspoon

One of my goals is to reduce the differences between using macOS and
Omarchy. I want it to look and feel as close as possible to reduce friction 
as I switch back and forth between them.

Obviously, there are things I just have to accept such as copy/paste. But for
lanching applications and web-pages, it would be nice to have consistent
keyboard shortcuts.

[Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org) is used to configure keyboard shortcuts on macOS. The keyboard
shortcuts are designed to be as close to [Hyprland shortcuts](https://github.com/jasondchambers/config-hypr/blob/main/bindings.conf) as possible.

Once you have installed [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org), simply copy
init.lua into ~/.hammerspoon/

These are the shortcuts:

| Key | Launches |
|---|---|
| option+s | Slack |
| option+n | Notion |
| option+g | Github |
| option+\<return\> | Alacritty |
| option+e | Gmail |
| option+o | Obsidian |
